The sample application executes statements to create a schema and insert some data into the database.

== Prerequisites

* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Download] and https://maven.apache.org/install.html[install] Maven.
* Create an Astra database and {secure-connect-bundle-url}[download your secure connect bundle] that contains connection information such as contact points and certificates.
* Create a minimal project structure as explained {java-project-url}[here]. 
* Create a xref:connecting-to-astra-java.adoc[connection to Astra].

== Procedure

Retrieving metadata for the cluster is good, but you also want to be able to read and write data to the cluster. 
The driver lets you execute CQL statements using a session instance that you retrieve from the cluster object. 
You will add code to your client to:

* create tables
* insert data into those tables

[.gcx-hook-connect='8-9']
== Drop a table if it exists

Drop the table if it already exists and you are rewriting the schema.

[.gcx-hook-connect='10-20']
== Create a table

Create a Cassandra Query Language (CQL) table with schema to store data.

[.gcx-hook-connect='22-33']
== Load (insert) data

Execute an INSERT statement to insert data into the table.

[.gcx-hook-connect='38-39']
== Modify the main code

Modify the main code to include calls to the new classes and execute the create and insert.

== Result

On the Astra dashboard, connect to the database and select the CQL Console tab.
Issue these two cqlsh commands:
1. USE demo;
2. DESCRIBE KEYSPACE demo;

This result is printed out:

....
